### Compare package.json
* Copied extra package references as it is from Metronic-Angular/dist/demo/default/package.json to xDesignSystems/package.json
* Renamed package-lock.json to package-lock.old.json
* npm installed again. That installed Metronic related packages and created new package.lock.json
* package.lock.json has some versions discrepencies 
### Compare and Configure angular-cli.json
* Both files almost same with exceptioon of inlineTemplate and inlineStyle set to true in Metronic-Angular/dist/demo/default/.
